#Background
Plays the game of Hangman, using randomly chosen sentences. Users are
shown a list of buttons with letters on them. Clicking on a letter will do
one of two things. It will either fill in the characters in the display for
the chosen letter, or it will mark an incorrect letter and increment the error
counter. Winning the game will display an alert congratulating the user.
